# Musketcraft
 Napoleonic Wars ASPIRE computer game
 
 In this game, you command the forces of the European powers during the start of the 19th Century, waging war with muskets, cannons, and cavalry.
 
# How to play:
  Commands:
   
   Units are grouped into formations, which you command by holding the flag with left click and dragging it to the destination. Once you place the flag, you can order the formation either "Move," ignoring enemies in sight until they arrive at the destination, or "Attack," allowing them to engage enemies they come across. You can also right click to cancel the moving of a flag.
   
   If you click on a unit in the formation, you may give other orders, such as changing formation or method of engaging the enemy. Right click or click outside the formation to cancel.
  
  Morale:
   
   In this new age of massive armies made of levied citizens marching in the face of increasingly deadly guns, soldiers are more likely to flee the battle than to stand their ground to the last man. Units are more likely to flee a formation that took heavy casualties, and are less likely to flee if they see more allies than enemies nearby.
   
 # Types of forces:
  Infantry:
   
   The backbone of any army, Infantry are fielded in much larger numbers than other types of forces. They are armed with muskets, which are inaccurate at maximum distances, but hit more often if you approach the enemy.
   
   Infantry can also be commanded to charge the enemy with bayonets. Bayonets make the enemy more likely to flee, but against an enemy that is not close to breaking, charging them can prove lethal.
   
   Infantry can also form a carre. This formation protects the Infantry from Cavalry charges, but leaves them immobile and unable to return fire effectively.
   
  Cavalry:
  
   Cavalry are used as shock troopers, charging vulnerable or key enemy troops and dispatching them quickly with their sabers. However, charging an Infantry from the front or in carre can prove disasterous.
   
  Cannon:
  
   Cannons fire roundshot that tears through the dense formations of Infantry and the large targets presented by Cavalry from a great range. However, they are few in number, and must be carefully guarded against melee attacks that can scare off the men manning them.
   
 # Hotkeys
  Since the recreations of historic battles are in progress, you can mess around by adding units at any time. First, choose their team with "q" for blue (Player), and "e" for green (Enemy), then press "z," "x," "c," for Infantry, Cannons, or Cavalry to be placed at your mouse. Press "f" to remove all units.
